# BTK
I am working on my thesis and improving my skills.
Currently implemented:
1) procedural generation of the dungeon (there are 3 different versions of it)
2) a card has been created for TD;
3) began to work with the script and the performance of TD.

An error occurred and the repository was deleted.
A month of running GitHub let's go...
